<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<h2 align="center">About the Project</h2>

This project employs HTML and CSS to build the single-page frontend interface and relies on advanced JavaScript to add the musical notes to the individual buttons that represent the drum-kit accessories. The drum-kit buttons can be easily triggered using mouseclick event or through specific keyboard buttons as visible on the frontend. Give it a go!!

Here's why it's so awesome:
* It brings the accessibility of a drum-kit directly to your fingertips.
* It's really easy to set up after forking and cloning the source code.

**You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.**
